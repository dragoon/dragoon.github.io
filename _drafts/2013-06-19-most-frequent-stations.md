In the lastest (3.4.6) version of the [Stationboards app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schedulr)
we have introduced ability to pick two most frequent stations directly during the *geo-location phase*.

This is important because geo-location sometimes can take considerable time, for many reasons.
And when this happened you had to manually type and select the desired station, which is really annoying.
That's where we come to the question why we have put precisely **two most frequent stations**.
Because the majority of people still have exactly two most frequent locations - home and office, and the ability
to quickly pick any of them should greatly decrease .... (though we didn't perform any deep study on this).
