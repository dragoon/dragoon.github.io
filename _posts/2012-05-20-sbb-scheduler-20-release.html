<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">We have finally made 2.0 release for the <i>Swiss Timetables</i> android app.<br /><br />In this release we have added one valuable feature - <i>favorite stations</i>. Basically, it allows you to mark specific stations as "favorite" stations, and then application will always stick to one of your favorite stations found nearby.<br />This feature becomes priceless when your phone <b>always finds nearest station incorrectly</b>, like one or two stations farther, and it could be super-annoying, but it no longer is. As soon as you put correct station to favorites list, it will be <b>always displayed first</b> when found nearby.<br /><br />You should&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;try it of you live in Switzerland and use public transport:<br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schedulr">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schedulr</a><br /><br />Next target - <i>iPhone</i>!</div></div>
