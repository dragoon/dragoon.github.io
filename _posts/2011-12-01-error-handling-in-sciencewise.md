It's not a secret that a lot of scientific projects suck when it comes to user interfaces. I think this usually happens because they can't just hire professional designers and usability experts, they should do a lot of&nbsp;<b>science</b>, conduct experiments, obtain data, you know,<b>&nbsp;</b>and such irregularity leads to ugly interfaces, if any.<br /><br />Here, at <b><a href="http://sciencewise.info/">ScienceWISE</a></b>, we also can't hire professional designers ;), but we always try to make the most of our abilities, try to make the project look attractive and make our visitors feel&nbsp;comfortable&nbsp;using it.<br /><br />Soon we will be releasing a lot of small visual interface improvements, and here I would like to take a look at one of them, because it is somewhat an nonstandard decision.<br /><br />So, here we have our main page, and now let's try to process article with some bad ID:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-saUxErwthBk/TtdCMH5JTYI/AAAAAAAADFU/VJ8XpmcWGwg/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.58.53+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="115" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-saUxErwthBk/TtdCMH5JTYI/AAAAAAAADFU/VJ8XpmcWGwg/s640/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.58.53+.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-74hFyTC8u_4/TtdCMkcHXGI/AAAAAAAADFY/l2SmEMvlHUc/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.59.10+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-74hFyTC8u_4/TtdCMkcHXGI/AAAAAAAADFY/l2SmEMvlHUc/s640/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.59.10+.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--DiQSo-KS_Y/TtdCNISBkcI/AAAAAAAADFk/4ybd9sM796A/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.59.28+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="118" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--DiQSo-KS_Y/TtdCNISBkcI/AAAAAAAADFk/4ybd9sM796A/s640/Screen+shot+2011-12-01+at+9.59.28+.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Ah, we got an error that is shown in the same field as a watermark text. And this error will disappear when we try to enter another article ID. Quite good? I definitely&nbsp;say yes, because this way we can save screen space comparing to the standard way of showing errors separate near input fields.</div>
