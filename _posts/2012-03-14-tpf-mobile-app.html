<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have always wanted to develop some mobile application, but somehow always had no time for it.<br /><br />As I work and live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, I use public transport on a daily basis to go to my work, and unfortunately I have problems with remembering the schedule of the buses. Moreover, I often leave work at different times, that makes remembering this informating even more challenging :) The only thing one can do is to print an A4 paper with the schedule, but again, it is really inconvenient to use it.<br /><br />So I decided to create an application that will show how much time is left till the next bust at the bus stops. I&nbsp;immediately fired up with this idea and decided not to postpone it for a long time and try to write a small prototype. Since I don't know <b>Objective C</b> and have not developed in <b>Java</b> for years, but have a good knowledge of&nbsp;<b>HTML/Javascript</b>, my choice fell on a cross-platform framework called&nbsp;<a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, which I have heard many positive reviews about.<br /><br />Very quickly I have found a great book from <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>, that at this moment is available for free inside their&nbsp;<i>Open Feedback Publishing System</i>: <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449383268/">Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. Among other libraries, they also used <a href="http://jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a>, that I also found really nice, though it is primarily focused on the <b>iPhone</b> users.<br /><br />After nearly week of work in the evenings, I have finally created the working prototype:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4dZK6IkLt04/T2DAy3UK8cI/AAAAAAAADYk/DZObugjm24I/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-03-14+at+17.00.37+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4dZK6IkLt04/T2DAy3UK8cI/AAAAAAAADYk/DZObugjm24I/s400/Screen+shot+2012-03-14+at+17.00.37+.png" width="328" /></a></div><br /><br />You can access it at:&nbsp;<a href="http://prokofyev.ch/tpf/">http://prokofyev.ch/tpf/</a><br /><br />The only bad thing about it is that the schedule data is not available online, that makes this app somewhat unusable (I've only added 3 bus stops that are important to me).<br />But as I work at the <i>University of Fribourg</i>, we will try to speak with the people from <a href="http://www.tpf.ch/">TPF</a>&nbsp;to make this data available.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
