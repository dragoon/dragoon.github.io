I have finally made 2.0 release for the **Swiss Stationboards** android app.

In this release we have added one valuable feature - *favorite stations*. Basically, it allows you to mark specific stations as "favorite" stations, and then application will always stick to one of your favorite stations found nearby.
This feature becomes priceless when your phone **always finds nearest station incorrectly**, like one or two stations farther, and it could be super-annoying, but it no longer is. As soon as you put correct station to favorites list, it will be **always displayed first** when found nearby.

You should definitely try it of you live in Switzerland and use public transport:
