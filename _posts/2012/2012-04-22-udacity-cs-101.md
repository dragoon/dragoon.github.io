Just received my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7737209/cs101%20udacity.pdf">statement of accomplishment</a> from <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> **with highest distinction**. Not a big deal since I'm quite mature software developer, but still very pleasant :)

From my experience, I would recommend to follow this course anyone who want to start learning **python. **It's way more exciting and fun than learning it from any book or whatever.
