This post continues the series of posts regarding ScienceWISE interface changes, and now I'd like to describe a little change to the article bookmarking page. Here how it looks like now:
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yNH7F92YtVU/TvJUtLtsuDI/AAAAAAAADGM/ff5P7YohPJE/s1600/add_concept.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="306" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yNH7F92YtVU/TvJUtLtsuDI/AAAAAAAADGM/ff5P7YohPJE/s640/add_concept.png" width="640" /></a>

When somebody wants to<b> add new concept</b> to the list of tags for the article, he clicks on the <b>autocomplete field</b> and this yellow additional help messages appears. But the only useful thing in this help is a <b>link to create new concept</b> that does not exist in our ontology.

So why won't we make this more convenient? And here is the solution that I came to:
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J9Ga3JUSc40/TvJO61z5LWI/AAAAAAAADGE/gCX-iwWexdU/s1600/add_concept1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J9Ga3JUSc40/TvJO61z5LWI/AAAAAAAADGE/gCX-iwWexdU/s1600/add_concept1.png" /></a>As you can see, the idea is to make a small "extension" to the autocomplete field. This extension is basically a link (anchor) represented by a "plus" button. Click on this button opens a new window with <b>create new concept </b>page.

And by the way, we also preserve the concept name typed inside autocomplete field, i.e. in <b>new concept window, </b>concept name is prepopulated with what was typed.
