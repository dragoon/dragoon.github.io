<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div><a href="https://www.ep.io/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://www.ep.io/static//images/logo.png" /></a></div>I've recently configured <a href="http://ep.io/">ep.io</a>&nbsp;python hosting (in my case - <b>django</b>) and found it to be really nice.<br />All configuration and deployment process took me about 2 hours and 50% of the time took writing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ep.io/docs/requirements/">requirements.txt</a> file describing my apps' dependencies.<br /><br />Documentation on the site is very straightforward and clear, and there is a special deployment script that makes all process very handy. Moreover, <b>epio </b>supplies one dynamic app instance and celery process <a href="https://www.ep.io/pricing/">for free</a>&nbsp;(like on Google App Engine)!<br />Actually that was the feature that finally convinced me to choose <a href="http://ep.io/">ep.io</a>&nbsp;instead of <a href="https://gondor.io/pricing/">gondor.io</a>&nbsp;(On <b>gondor</b>, I need to pay 10$ for each slot, thus for 1 Django WSGI + PostgreSQL + Celery = 30$ per month at least).<br /><br />So now you can find a copy of <a href="http://prestashop-sync.com/">Prestashop-Sync</a> on epio, at&nbsp;<a href="http://prestashop-sync.ep.io/">http://prestashop-sync.ep.io/</a>. It can be used if the main site is offline for some reason (but Databases there are not synced).</div></div>
