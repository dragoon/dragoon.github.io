<h3>ScienceWISE (<a href="http://sciencewise.info">http://sciencewise.info</a>)</h3>
<p>ScienceWISE allows a community of scientists, working in a specific domain, to generate
    dynamically as part of their daily work an interactive semantic environment, i.e., a
    field-specific ontology with direct connections to the text of research papers.
    The SW system includes a number of crucial elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>an expanding collection of eld-specic community-ranked encyclopedia
        articles (mostly about physics at this point of time)
    </li>
    <li>an ontological structure (concepts and logical relations between them) encompassing this
        encyclopedia
    </li>
    <li>established connections from ontology entries to a vast collection of research papers
        (<a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>)
    </li>
    <li>an operational platform, allowing scientists to annotate and conceptually index (bookmark)
        research papers, link them
        against the ontology, and validate and dynamically update the ontology through annotations.
    </li>
</ul>
